      "description": "I’ve been into trucks and off-roading my whole life, and after spending five years working in the off-road industry, I saw firsthand how fast this space is evolving. What stood out to me most is that we can still build high-quality, thoughtfully designed products right here in the U.S. that actually make sense for the people who use them every day.",
      "description_additional_one": "Flatbeds have always grabbed my attention, but most options felt overbuilt or too limited. That’s why I started Far Out Flatbeds, to create a modular aluminum platform that’s strong, lightweight, and adaptable. Our goal is simple: build a bed that grows with your truck and your lifestyle. Designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, Far Out Flatbeds redefines what a flatbed can be with innovation, practicality, and style at its core.",
