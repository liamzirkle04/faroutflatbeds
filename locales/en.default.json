      "title": "FAR OUT FLATBEDS",
      "subtitle": "Born From Experience",
      "description": "I've been into trucks and off-roading pretty much my whole life. For the last five years I've worked in the off-road industry, which gave me a front row seat to how this space has grown and where it's heading. The biggest thing I have taken away is the idea that we can build cool, well-thought-out stuff right here in the U.S., and do it in a way that actually makes sense for the people using it. That's where the idea for Far Out Flatbeds was born. By using extruded aluminum as the backbone of the bed, we're able to create a platform that's both strong and incredibly versatile. The goal is modularity — a bed that adapts to you, your truck, and your lifestyle.\n\nFar Out Flatbeds isn't just about building truck beds — it's about rethinking what a flatbed can be. A product designed by enthusiasts, for enthusiasts, with innovation, practicality, and style at its core."
