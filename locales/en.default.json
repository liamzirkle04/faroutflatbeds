      "title": "FAR OUT FLATBEDS",
      "subtitle": "Born From Experience",
      "description": "I’ve been into trucks and off-roading pretty much my whole life. For the last five years I’ve worked in the off-road industry, which gave me a front row seat to how this space has grown and where it’s heading. The biggest thing I have taken away is the idea that we can build cool, well-thought-out stuff right here in the U.S., and do it in a way that actually makes sense for the people using it. Flatbeds have always caught my eye, but most felt overbuilt, limited, or not flexible enough. I wanted something modular that could change with your setup instead of locking you into one.",
      "description_additional_one": "That idea became Far Out Flatbeds. Using extruded aluminum as the backbone, we built a platform that’s strong, lightweight, and endlessly adaptable — a bed that fits you, your truck, and your lifestyle.",
      "description_additional_two": "Far Out Flatbeds is about more than building beds. It’s about rethinking what a flatbed can be — designed by enthusiasts, for enthusiasts, with innovation, practicality, and style at its core.",
      "description_additional_three": "",
      "narrative_heading": "Engineered for real miles",
      "narrative_body": "The thing that sets this bed apart from anything else on the market is its ability to flatpack ship straight to your door, paired with the modularity of an extruded aluminum deck. That means you can bolt on just about any accessory you can think of, and you're not locked into a single setup.\n\nIt's a flatbed built to change and adapt to whatever job or activity you're into. On top of that, it's designed to be universal. If you ever upgrade trucks — as long as it's a similar size and bed length, you can bring your flatbed with you.\n\nInstead of starting over every time you change rigs, your setup stays with you."
